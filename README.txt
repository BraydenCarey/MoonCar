This program was developed using java 1.8 using IntelliJ IDEA.

//Functionality Issues
* Program will allow multiple Moon Cars but will not check where they are placed. A moon car can drive through
  the same location as another Moon Car should this occur or should this report an error like
 " Critical error: Moon Cars 1 and 2 have been destroyed"?

 * Do I assume the input file will be of correct format or should the input file be checked for correctness?

 * Currently doesn't check for going out of bounds. Should the moon car ignore commands that would drive it
    off the plateau or report an error when the car drives off the edge.
